This project involves the design and simulation of a closed-loop speed-controlled two-quadrant DC motor drive using MATLAB. The system employs a three-phase phase-controlled rectifier for armature voltage control, cascaded PI controllers for current and speed regulation, and regenerative braking capabilities.

##  Project Overview
- **Objective**: Achieve precise speed control of a DC motor while maintaining safe operating limits.
- **Key Features**:
  - Two-quadrant operation (forward motoring and regenerative braking).
  - Closed-loop control with cascaded current and speed controllers.
  - MATLAB simulations for stability analysis (Bode plots, step responses).
- **Applications**: Industrial motor drives, electric vehicles, robotics.

##  Key Concepts
- **Two-Quadrant Control**: Allows motoring (forward direction) and regenerative braking.
- **Cascade Control**:
  - **Inner Loop**: Current controller adjusts rectifier firing angle (Œ±).
  - **Outer Loop**: Speed controller generates current reference (i‚Çê*).
- **Regenerative Braking**: Converts kinetic energy to electrical energy during deceleration.

##  Design Steps
1. **Converter Design**:
   - Calculated converter gain: `Kr = 31.05 V/V`.
   - Transfer function: `Gr(s) = 31.05 / (1 + 0.00138s)`.
2. **Current Controller**:
   - Time constant `Tc = 0.0208s`, gain `Kc = 2.33`.
3. **Speed Controller**:
   - Total time constant `T4 = 0.0047s`, gain `K8 = 28.73`.
